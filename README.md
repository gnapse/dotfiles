# gnapse/dotfiles

These are config files to set up a system the way I like it.

After some time using clones of someone else's dotfiles, I decided to rool out my own. This has allowed me to learn and tweak things better to my liking. I have of course kept the ideas I've learned and liked from other dotfiles collections.

## Installation

Run the following commands in your terminal.

```terminal
git clone git://github.com/gnapse/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles
~/.dotfiles/install
```

After installing, open a new terminal window to see the effects.
